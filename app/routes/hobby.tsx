      <p>
        Like many people, I like drawing and playing games. In addition, I added
        Making Wiki to my hobby list three years ago and currently it took most
        of my leisure time. Three years ago a friend who played the game Legends
        of the Three Kingdoms invited me to create a Wiki of the game using the
        platform Bilibili because there was no existing Wiki that does a great
        job of covering all aspects of the game characters. It was a great
        learning process of reading through Mediawiki and Semantic Media Wiki
        for creating and querying data on this platform, and well as getting
        inspirations of source code and look from other game BiliWiki. With the
        experiece in building this first Wiki, I further created Wikis for more
        games that I play, and I have helped 3 other games enhancing their wiki
        UI. I am now mainly working on the Arknights Wiki. In 2023 I won the
        second prize in the annual Biliwiki contributors award.
