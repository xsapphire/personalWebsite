      "Graduated with the passion of bringing technology to traditional industries, I was introduced to the founder of Square 8, a startup that was just founded to develop a software solution for drayage process, by my professor's friend. Although I did not have any knowledge about the drayage industry prior to the joining of the project, the founder shared his vision of future logistics industry operated on a better management software with me and I saw the value of this future. After joining the company, I started with learning about the basics of drayage industry, including industry terminologies and operation process. In addition to reading textbook, I spent a lot more time sitting with operators in the parent logistics companies observing, asking and recording. While doing user research, I learned the difficulties they had with the current management software and the current workflow process. With a better understanding of they are facing, I started by drafting designs for products.",

      "The founder's vision started with a mobile app that drivers can use to facilitate their communication with the trucking management companies, and thus I started by drafting a flow chart and a set of mobile screen designs. As we talked to the operators from the parent logistics companies, we realized how old and stale their platform is, and how hard it is to integrate. We were ambitious and decided to make a full container management platform alongside with the mobile app. Out target users were then expanded to brokers, trucking management companies, drivers, and customers that give loads. I have collected needs from each of them, drafted designs for the mobile app, operator web portal, and customer web portal, and regularly held meetings to get feedback from users.",

      "While I had a preference on product design and front-end development, wehad a senior backend engineer to start the project together. I have worked closely with him to design workflow and database schema, and we picked Apollo GraphQL for implementing API. When we were in the process ofrecruiting, I wrote some of the resolvers on the middle tier with Golang, but soon I got my feet off from this ground and jumped into mobile app development.",

      "I started with programming a useable Android app with Kotlin which went through a field test with a driver from the parent trucking management company. Later we decided to make a lite version so that it can be put in use faster, and therefore we designed a second version of mobile app with fewer but essential functions, and I developed an iOS app with SwiftUI. Meanwhile the product manager introduced some contractor who had experience in iOS app development to help me with any problems I had. The mobile app was mostly done after some time, but the web management platform that it was supposed to be integrated into was far from complete, and therefore I moved to the web application team to help with the plaform and decided to stay there. 2-3 years later the Android mobile app got picked up by a full-stack engineer before we were about to launch the plaform.",

      "As our product scope became larger, we kept having new members to our team. We had senior engineers, product managers, and executive members joining us, providing a lot of valuable insights and advice to the team. I gradually moved to web application development and decided to be more professional with my front-end skill. When I gradudate from the university, I was able to draw, organize and code to make something look like what I want, but I lack professionalityin these skills. While working with our senior product manager, senior UX designer and leading frontend engineer, I learned how to systematically  define design tokens and components, organize designs on Figma, and more importantly, care for code quality and client-side web performance.

      "Unfortunately even though we had already developed a product that is operational, right before Beta release Square 8 was ordered to shut down by the boss of the parent logisitic company in July 2024 as our project lost his trust, and without the support of parent logisitics company, we as a technology solution lost the foundation of operational expertise of managing the person on the ground to do the work. We had a great team and I had so much takeaways from this precious experience. The front-end work experience at Square 8 had a great impact on me - it brought me into the world of React and Typescript, it got me into the habit of writing readable code by decomponentizing the code and wellstructuring the repository, and on top of that, it taught me how to research and find the solutions for the problems we had at work.",
